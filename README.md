# mobile-first-website
An exercise for the construction of a website designed for mobile users. The focus was on creating a responsive design with a nice scrolling effect for mobile users and a parallax effect for desktop.

All the assets employed are from public domain sources: the photos are from  USGS Library, while the vector arrow is from publicdomainvectors.org.
